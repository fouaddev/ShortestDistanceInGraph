# ShortestDistanceInGraph
Simple Java application that builds a Graph with user input data. This is a class project. It uses two heuristic algorithms to navigate and find the shortest distance from any given city in the graph to the final destination Z.

# How to run the application
Just run project.java file which will prompt you to enter the first letter of the city and the application will calculate the shortest distance to the final destination Z using two different heuristic algorithms. 
it will display the Sequence of all Cities, and the shortest path to the final destination Z, as well as the path length.
